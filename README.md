# Hello,

This is a mini project to design a store front/landing page for a company. 
It features a popout menu/search bar and is built using Tailwindcss, React, and Typescript.

As of the moment, I consider the project finished as it will be the first of a series of mini project I will take on across Summer 2022,
but I may revisit to make a completed version in the future.

Best,

-Kay
